# InstaSumm: Empowering Users with API-Driven Text Summarization and Personalizable Notes 

## **Abstract**  
Information processing is one of the most important aspects of the digital age. InstaSumm is a web-based application designed for effective text summarization, utilizing the Facebook BART API. The application features a user-centric interface built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), ensuring robust backend support for handling API requests and managing data flow.  

InstaSumm enables users to:  
- Generate concise summaries from lengthy text inputs.  
- Reorder and personalize summarized content as sticky notes.  
- Customize sticky notes with adjustable text formatting, including bold, italics, colors, and background colors for better organization and readability.  

Future enhancements include integrating multimedia elements, allowing users to upload images as part of their notes, creating a comprehensive multimodal information management tool tailored for academic and professional users.
